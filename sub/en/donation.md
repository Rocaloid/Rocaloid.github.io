### Help Rocaloid to Grow

---

&emsp;&emsp;Although Rocaloid is a non-profit project, it does not mean development costs nothing.

&emsp;&emsp;Costs during development process include:

* &emsp;&emsp;Purchasing equipment (such as professional microphone and soundcard).

* &emsp;&emsp;Renting sites (studio).

* &emsp;&emsp;Purchasing software (more powerful development tools can help us save time).

* &emsp;&emsp;Purchasing professional books (studying).

* &emsp;&emsp;Purchasing a domain name (rocaloid.org).

&emsp;&emsp;Sleepwalking with his classmates has spent thousands of Chinese Yuan on Rocaloid.

&emsp;&emsp;Your donation will speed up Rocaloid development and make the dream come true sooner.
