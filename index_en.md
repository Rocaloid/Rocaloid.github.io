&emsp;Welcome to the world of Rocaloid!

&emsp;&emsp;Rocaloid is a free and open-source vocal synthesizer system, the final purpose is to implement a *natural, fast, flexible, and language-independent* vocal synthesis.

&emsp;&emsp;Like many similar software, after installing Rocaloid with a set of soundfont (*or voicebank*), you just need to type in the lyrics and sketch out the melody in order to synthesize fabulous songs. Rocaloid features rich paramaters so that precious adjustment can be made to the resulting vocal to reach a better quality. A full set of Rocaloid voice soundfont can produce any song containing syllable structure.

&emsp;&emsp;Great technical difficulty is on the way of implementing such a synthesizer system. Three years have passed since the project begins, although any stable release has not yet completed, we have acquired [phased achievement](/sub/en/posts.html). In fact, this project has been [refactored twice](/sub/en/history.html). The third refactoring is taking place currently. We believe that by refactoring each time can we improve it, and the dream of Rocaloid could come true.
